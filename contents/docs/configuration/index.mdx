# Configuration

## 2.1. Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store important information that your project needs to function. They keep sensitive data like API keys and database URLs safe and secure.

Firstly, rename the .env.example file to .env, so you can start working on it.

## Obtaining Environment Variables
