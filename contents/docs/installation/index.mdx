# Installation

To begin using Starfall, all that is required is a couple of things.

## Step 1
- Well, the first thing you should do is make sure that Node.js is installed on your computer.
- You will even need npm, which is a tool for package management.
- After that, you're all set up to enter Starfall and build your app.

## Step 2
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArjunCodess/neon-oss-starter-kit.git my-app
    ```
    

## Step 3

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```
    
## Step 4

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Step 5
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Your terminal should be looking like this, by now.

## Step 6

And now, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to continue.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Starfall Starter Kit on your machine. You can now start building your next big project using the built-in components and features provided by the kit.

But guess what?

This doesn't work and the site throws an error!

The reason is the environment variables. Letâ€™s take a look at them in the next section.
